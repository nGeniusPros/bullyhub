## Adding New Assets

When adding new assets:

1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory based on their purpose
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Optimize images for web use before adding them
4. Update this README if you create new subdirectories

## Image Optimization

- All images should be optimized for web use
- Use SVG for icons and logos when possible
- Use WebP or JPEG for photos, with appropriate compression
- Keep file sizes as small as possible without sacrificing quality
