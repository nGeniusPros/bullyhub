# Vertical Slice Architecture Migration Plan

## Current Status
- Existing API routes are organized in a traditional monolithic structure
- Codebase audit identified 45 API routes requiring migration
- Vertical slice architecture will organize routes by feature domain
- Initial audit shows highest complexity in user-related routes

## Migration Priorities
1. High-Risk Routes:
   - Authentication (login, registration)
   - Payment processing
   - User profile management
2. Medium-Risk Routes:
   - Content management
   - Reporting features
3. Low-Risk Routes:
   - Static data fetching
   - Utility functions

## Step-by-Step Migration Plan

1. Preparation:
   - Create vertical slice structure
   - Set up feature directories
   - Update base application template

2. Initial Migrations:
   - Migrate 3 core routes (login, dashboard, profile)
   - Establish testing framework
   - Create feature context providers

3. Iterative Migrations:
   - Migrate remaining routes 4-6
   - Implement feature-specific error handling
   - Add route-specific testing

4. Finalize:
   - Remove legacy routes
   - Update redirects
   - Optimize performance

## Required Changes per Feature
- New feature directory structure
- Feature-specific context providers
- Updated routing configuration
- Enhanced error handling
- New feature-specific tests

## Testing Strategy
1. Automated tests per vertical slice
2. End-to-end testing
3. Performance monitoring
4. Feature-specific validation

## Post-Migration Verification Steps
1. Confirm all routes function
2. Verify error handling
3. Check performance metrics
4. Ensure security compliance
